Description: Data presented from a heifer supplementation study conducted by Ira Parsons under the supervision of Gordon Carstens at the McGregor Agrilife Research station in McGregor, Texas. Heifers were supplemented with a feed additive in a 2x2 factorial crossover design. Heifers were weighed using chute scale, and in the post-weaning phase were fed a totally mixed ration in a GrowSafe (Vitalle) Feed Intake System.
